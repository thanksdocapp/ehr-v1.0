| This file has been completely cleared to prevent route naming conflicts.
| All admin routes are now properly organized in web.php under the 
| 'admin.' prefix with appropriate middleware.
|
| This resolves the Laravel route caching error:
| "Unable to prepare route [admin/users/{user}] for serialization. 
|  Another route has already been assigned name [admin.users.update]."
|
*/

// NO ROUTES DEFINED HERE - All admin functionality is in web.php
// This prevents duplicate route names and allows route caching to work
